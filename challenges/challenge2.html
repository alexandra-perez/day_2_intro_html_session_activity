    <h2>Understanding Recycling Process</h2>
    <p>
      Recycling transforms waste materials into new products, reducing the need
      for virgin resources and minimizing environmental impact. It involves
      collecting, sorting, and processing materials such as paper, glass,
      plastic, and metals. By recycling, we can conserve natural resources, save
      energy, and reduce pollution.

    <h2>Effective Waste Management Practices</h2>
    <p>
      Effective waste management goes beyond recycling. It includes reducing the
      amount of waste generated, reusing items whenever possible, and disposing
      of waste responsibility. Composting organic waste, avoiding single-use
      plastics, and supporting products made from recycled materials are key
      steps toward sustainable waste management.
